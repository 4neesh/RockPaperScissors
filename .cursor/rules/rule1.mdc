# Python Object-Oriented Development Guidelines

## General Principles

* **Language Selection:** Always use Python when creating new files.
* **Development Paradigm:** Implement an object-oriented approach for all new code.

## Object-Oriented Implementation

* **Class-Based Design:** Structure your code around classes that encapsulate related data and behavior.
* **Inheritance:** Use inheritance appropriately to promote code reuse.
* **Encapsulation:** Properly encapsulate class attributes and methods to control access.
* **Polymorphism:** Leverage polymorphic behavior when designing class hierarchies.
